none

ANSWERS:
WhatIdo works as follows: it should receive a single argument which is a string.
If it doesn't receive any argument or receives multiple arguments
it will print "Error. The program should receive a single argument. Exiting."
If the input is correct it will do the following: 
it will make a directory called "Welcome" inside it another directory called "To"
and lastly it creates a file called OS2021 in which it writes in it as follows:
"<user>
 If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
 <arg>"
where <user> is the cse username and <arg> is the argument for the program
